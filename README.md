# ESPHome Hoermann Supramatic E3

This is a modification of the E3 Code of [@lg2dc](https://github.com/lg2dc/hoermann_door/tree/main/esphome) to get it working with ESPHome and the HÃ¶rmann Supramatic E3. It is a work in progress but it is in a working state. Feel free to modify and complete it! :)

The "garage-door-includes" folder has to be put in the ESPHome folder so it can be accessed and used when compiling (in my Home Assistant folder structure, its "/config/esphome/garage-door-includes/garage_door_component.h" when accessing the internal file browser).
